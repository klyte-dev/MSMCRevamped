# MSMCRevamped
****CURRENTLY STABLE****

*Automarklost does not work flawlessly - not me*

MSMC Revamped is a improved version of MSMC (original creator : MachineKillin check him out on github)
It has a GUI I`ve added more efficient checking and made a functioning automarklost feature. Ive also improved some other things but thats the main part

Anyone is free to use/modify/share my code. Enjoy!
